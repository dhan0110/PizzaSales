Plato's Pizza is a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. The restaurant has been collecting transactional data for the past year, but haven't been able to put it to good use. They
would like to find out opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently. 

As a Data Consultant hired by the restaurant to find useful insights to improve operations – these are some queries to answer – best and worst selling pizza, average order value, busy days / times, current seat utilization etc.

ML models to forecast pizza sales revenue and pizza counts sold are built in order to help the restaurant with personnel planning and improving sales.
